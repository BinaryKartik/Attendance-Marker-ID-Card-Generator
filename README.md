# Attendance-Marker-ID-Card-Generator
Using this you can create id cards and also mark your attendance by scanning the id card, but this will work only if you scan it using the inbuilt scanner. The attendance will be saved in a file named "Data for ID Generator.xlsx". You can clear the data anytime through the software. To generate ID CARD enter 1 when asked. Then enter the details asked and your id would be saved in the same folder in which the python code is. Same for the attendance, you have to enter the name of the id card's image then it would create a .xlsx file and save the data. There would also be a sheet named "Background Tasks" please don't delete it until and unless you don't want to not use the software as it contains some values for backend processing.
